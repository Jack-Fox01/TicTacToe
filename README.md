🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe in Java (Swing GUI)
A simple 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java and Swing. This project features a graphical interface, user interaction, and basic game logic such as win and tie conditions.

🚀 Features
- Two-player gameplay: X and O alternate turns
- Color-coded win/tie highlights
- GUI built using Java Swing
- Turn tracker and end-of-game messaging


🧠 How It Works
- The game board is a 3x3 grid of JButtons in a GridLayout.
- Players take turns clicking on tiles to place "X" or "O".
- After each move, the game checks for:
- Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins
- A tie (when the board is full with no winner)
- The current player's turn and the winner/tie message are displayed at the top.

🎨 UI Design
- Dark-themed background with bold fonts
- Winning tiles are highlighted in green
- Tie tiles are highlighted in orange

  🧩 Future Improvements
- Add a restart/reset button
- Implement single-player mode (AI opponent)
- Track score over multiple rounds
- Improve responsiveness and UX design
